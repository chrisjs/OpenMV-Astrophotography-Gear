This circuit schematic and PCB design is a variation of the OpenMV WiFi shield.

The original GitHub repo for the OpenMV WiFi shield is found at [https://github.com/openmv/openmv-boards/tree/master/shields/wifi](https://github.com/openmv/openmv-boards/tree/master/shields/wifi)

It allows for a bigger camera lens to be mounted. It also adds a ST-4 port in order to control telescope mounts.
